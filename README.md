## Description
This application was made during my Apprenticeship at Ubisoft. With my assigned team, we managed to make a turn based application in ReactJS for the front-end side and Node.js with other middleware (such as Express) for the back-end. Furthermore, we used Docker for containerisation and OpenAI's API to facilitate the "battle" between user and AI in a simple wording game.
